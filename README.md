# STAT5261: Statistical Method for Finance Final Project

In this project, we analyzed 12 different stocks using Python and R codes, and wrote a project report. Below are the files and folders we handed in:

### 1. Daily & Monthly Folders

These two folders contain daily/monthly data of 12 assets, and I also put some plots that can statistically describe these data inside `Histogram Plots` and `Q-Q Plots` folders inside.

### 2. Daily/Monthly.csv

These two csv files contain daily/monthly returns of 12 assets.

### 3. Project.ipynb

This is the main part of the codes, which contains all parts of the codes except for Copula part. If you want to reproduce the code, you can build a virtual conda environment using `env.yaml`.

### 4. Copulas.rmd

This is the R Markdown file contains the codes which calculate copulas on each pair of assets. Here we use R instead of Python to make the result shown more directly.
